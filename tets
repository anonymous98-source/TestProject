I’ll give you the complete text version of all 80 Full-Stack Java Developer interview questions and answers here directly — no download needed.
Because it is very long, I’ll format it cleanly in batches of 20 so your app doesn’t freeze.
✅ FULL STACK JAVA INTERVIEW QUESTIONS — TEXT FORMAT
✅ (Batch 1: Questions 1–20)
✅ 1. Difference between HashMap, ConcurrentHashMap, and SynchronizedMap
• HashMap: Not thread-safe, allows 1 null key & many null values, fastest for single-threaded systems.
• SynchronizedMap: Thread-safe but locks entire map — low performance.
• ConcurrentHashMap: Thread-safe with segment-level locking → better concurrency, does NOT allow null.
Where used?
In multi-threaded caches, rate-limiting counters, shared config store, login sessions.
✅ 2. JVM Memory Model
• Heap → Stores objects (new User())
• Stack → Method calls & local variables
• Metaspace → Class metadata
• PC Register → Next instruction for each thread
• Native Stack → C/C++ operations
Garbage Collection:
Modern JVM uses G1GC, collects smaller regions → low pause time.
✅ 3. volatile vs synchronized vs ReentrantLock
FeaturevolatilesynchronizedReentrantLockVisibility✅✅✅Thread safety❌✅✅Blocking❌✅✅Advanced features❌❌✅ fairness, tryLock, unlock manually 
✅ 4. What is ThreadLocal?
Stores a variable separately for every thread.
Used for:
• Request context in microservices
• User session
• Logging trace ID
• Avoids synchronization
✅ 5. Functional programming in Java
Java 8 introduces:
• Lambda expressions
• Streams API
• Optional
• Higher-order functions
Example:
list.stream().filter(x -> x > 10).collect(Collectors.toList()); 
✅ 6. equals() & hashCode() contract
• If two objects are equal → must produce same hashCode.
• If hashCode differs → objects are not equal.
• Required for HashSet, HashMap, LinkedHashMap.
✅ 7. Callable vs Runnable
• Runnable → no return value, cannot throw checked exceptions
• Callable → returns value, can throw exceptions, used with ExecutorService
✅ 8. Immutable class
• All fields private + final
• No setters
• Class declared final
• Return defensive copies
✅ Thread-safe & used in DTOs, caching, currency, date-time APIs.
✅ 9. How Garbage Collection works
GC removes unreachable objects from Heap.
Algorithms:
• Serial GC
• Parallel GC
• CMS GC
• G1 GC → default modern collector
✅ 10. Spring MVC flow
Client → DispatcherServlet → HandlerMapping → Controller → Service → Repository → ViewResolver → Response sent back.
✅ 11. Difference between @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller
• @Component → generic bean
• @Service → business logic
• @Repository → database layer, exception translation
• @Controller → MVC Controller
• @RestController → returns JSON
✅ 12. Spring Bean Lifecycle
• Instantiate Bean
• Dependency Injection
• @PostConstruct
• Bean ready
• @PreDestroy
✅ 13. What is AOP?
Aspect-Oriented Programming → separates cross-cutting concerns:
• Logging
• Auditing
• Security
• Transactions
• Caching
Uses Advice, Pointcut, JoinPoint.
✅ 14. @Transactional propagation levels
• REQUIRED → join existing or create new
• REQUIRES_NEW → always new transaction
• MANDATORY → must have existing one
• SUPPORTS → runs with or without transaction
• NEVER → error if transaction exists
✅ 15. RestTemplate vs WebClient vs Feign
FeatureRestTemplateWebClientFeignTypeSynchronousAsynchronous reactiveDeclarative clientBest useSimple blocking callsHigh-performance RESTMicroservices 
✅ 16. Securing APIs — JWT
• Client logs in → server generates JWT token
• Client sends token in Authorization header
• Server validates signature
• No session stored on server → stateless
JWT contains:
• Header (algorithm)
• Payload (user details / roles)
• Signature
✅ 17. What is Circuit Breaker?
Stops calling failing service after threshold.
Prevents cascading failure.
Using Resilience4J:
• Closed → normal
• Open → stop requests
• Half-open → test few requests
• Closed again if successful
✅ 18. Service Discovery (Eureka/Consul)
Instead of hardcoding IPs:
• Each service registers with server
• Other services resolve by name
Example:
http://USER-SERVICE/users/1 
✅ 19. API Gateway
Single entry point for clients:
• Routing
• Load balancing
• Authentication
• Rate limiting
• Logging
Tools: Spring Cloud Gateway, Zuul, NGINX, Kong
✅ 20. Idempotency in REST
Calling same operation multiple times gives same result.
Example:
• PUT /users/10 → safe
• DELETE /orders/1 → safe
• POST → not idempotent unless unique ID token used

Great ✅
Here is Batch 2 of 4 — Questions 21 to 40, each with detailed answers.
✅ FULL STACK JAVA INTERVIEW Q&A
✅ (Batch 2: Questions 21–40)
✅ 21. Saga Pattern vs Two-Phase Commit
Two-Phase Commit (2PC)
• Distributed transaction across multiple services
• Coordinator ensures commit or rollback on all
• Strong consistency
• But: ❌ Slow
❌ Locks resources
❌ Single point of failure
Saga Pattern
• Long-running transactions broken into local steps
• Each step has a compensating action (undo)
• Event-driven and asynchronous
• Used in microservices
Example:
• Order Service → Payment Service → Inventory Service
• If inventory fails → undo payment → undo order
✅ Saga preferred in microservices.
✅ 22. Event-Driven Architecture
Instead of API to API calls:
• Services publish events (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
• Other services subscribe
Advantages: ✅ Loose coupling
✅ High scalability
✅ Async processing
✅ Failure isolation
Used in:
• Order → Payment → Inventory → Notification flows
✅ 23. What is API Versioning?
When API changes, older clients should still work.
Methods: ✅ URL versioning → /api/v1/users
✅ Header versioning → X-API-VERSION: 2
✅ Query param → /users?version=2
✅ 24. ACID vs CAP Theorem
ACID (Databases)
• Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
• SQL DBs ensure strong consistency
CAP (Distributed systems)
A system can only guarantee two:
• Consistency
• Availability
• Partition tolerance
Microservices pick AP or CP based on use case.
✅ 25. Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
• INNER JOIN → matching records only
• LEFT JOIN → all from left + matches
• RIGHT JOIN → all from right + matches
Example:
SELECT * FROM users u LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id; 
✅ 26. What are Database Indexes?
Indexes speed up reads by creating sorted structures (B-Trees, Hash).
✅ Fast SELECT
❌ Slower INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
Used on:
• Frequent search columns
• Foreign keys
• Large tables
✅ 27. How do you optimize slow SQL queries?
• Add indexes
• Avoid SELECT *
• Avoid subqueries → use JOIN
• Analyze query execution plan
• Use caching
• Partition large tables
✅ 28. Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking
Optimistic
• No locks
• Check version before commit
• Good for low contention
@Version private int version; 
Pessimistic
• Locks row until commit
• Good for high contention
@Lock(PESSIMISTIC_WRITE) 
✅ 29. Why use NoSQL?
Use when: ✅ Schema changes frequently
✅ High write/read throughput
✅ Horizontal scaling
✅ Store JSON
Examples:
• MongoDB → document store
• Redis → cache
• Cassandra → distributed key-value
✅ 30. Sharding vs Partitioning
FeaturePartitioningShardingLocationSame DB serverDifferent DB serversPurposeHandle huge tablesDistribute load across nodesExamplePartition by dateUserID % 10 → 10 DBs 
✅ 31. Connection Pooling (HikariCP)
Instead of opening a new DB connection every time:
• A pool of open connections is reused
• Faster & more scalable
Spring Boot uses HikariCP (default) — fastest modern pool.
✅ 32. Database Isolation Levels
LevelProblem PreventedRead UncommittedNoneRead CommittedDirty ReadsRepeatable ReadDirty + Non-repeatable readsSerializableAll issues (slowest) 
✅ 33. JPA: Lazy vs Eager Loading
• Lazy → fetch only when accessed
• Eager → fetch immediately
Lazy is preferred to prevent performance issues.
Big mistake: Eager + large relationships = huge memory + slow queries.
✅ 34. N+1 SELECT Problem
Problem:
• Fetch parent list → N SQL queries for child rows
Fix: ✅ JOIN FETCH
✅ EntityGraph
✅ BatchSize
Example:
@Query("SELECT u FROM User u JOIN FETCH u.orders") 
✅ 35. Hibernate 1st & 2nd Level Cache
Level-1 Cache
• Per session (mandatory)
• Same session won’t hit DB twice
Level-2 Cache
• Across sessions
• Uses Ehcache / Redis
✅ 36. @OneToMany, @ManyToMany
@OneToMany:
@OneToMany(mappedBy="user", fetch=LAZY) List<Order> orders; 
@ManyToMany:
@ManyToMany @JoinTable(name="student_course") 
Always keep collections LAZY for performance.
✅ 37. SPA vs MPA
SPA (React/Angular):
• Loads once, communicates via REST
• Fast navigation
• Needs API backend
MPA (JSP/Thymeleaf):
• Full page reloads
• Server-side rendering
✅ 38. State Management
React:
• useState → component local state
• Context API → global state
• Redux → large apps, predictable state
✅ 39. What is Virtual DOM?
• React creates lightweight copy of DOM
• Compares with previous version (diffing)
• Applies minimal changes
• Faster UI updates than manipulating real DOM
✅ 40. What is CORS and how to fix it?
CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
Browser blocks calls to different domain/origin.
Fix in Spring Boot:
@CrossOrigin(origins = "*") 
Or global config:
registry.addMapping("/**").allowedOrigins("*");

Great ✅
Here comes Batch 3 — Questions 41 to 60, with clear and detailed explanations.
✅ FULL STACK JAVA INTERVIEW Q&A
✅ (Batch 3: Questions 41–60)
✅ 41. What are REST constraints?
A RESTful API must follow:
• Client-Server → UI separate from data
• Stateless → No session stored on server
• Cacheable → Responses can be cached
• Layered System → Proxy or gateway allowed
• Uniform Interface → Standard HTTP verbs and URIs
• HATEOAS (optional) → Links inside response
✅ 42. What is HATEOAS?
REST response includes hyperlinks to next actions.
Example:
{ "id": 10, "name": "Rugved", "_links": { "orders": "/users/10/orders", "update": "/users/10" } } 
Used in strongly connected REST ecosystems.
✅ 43. Pagination, Filtering & Sorting in REST
• Pagination → ?page=1&size=20
• Sorting → ?sort=name,asc
• Filtering → ?status=ACTIVE
Spring Data supports pageable:
Page<User> users = repo.findAll(PageRequest.of(1, 20)); 
✅ 44. Common HTTP Status Codes
CodeMeaning200OK201Created202Accepted (async processing)204No content400Bad request401Unauthorized (login required)403Forbidden (access denied)404Not found409Conflict (duplicate data)500Server error 
✅ 45. How to design secure file upload API
• Validate file type
• Limit file size
• Store in S3 or secured local folder

• Store metadata in DB
• Never allow direct file path access
✅ 46. Difference between Docker Image and Container
Docker ImageDocker ContainerRead-only blueprintRunning instance of imageLike a classLike an objectStored in registryRuns on Docker engine 
✅ 47. Dockerfile basics
Example:
FROM openjdk:17 COPY app.jar /app.jar ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"] 
Build: docker build -t myapp .
Run: docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp
✅ 48. Docker Compose
Runs multi-container setup:

• Rolling updates
Key Resources:
• Pods
• Deployments
• Services
• Ingress
✅ 50. Blue-Green & Canary Deployment
Blue-Green
• Two environments: Blue (live), Green (new)
• Switch traffic instantly for zero downtime
Canary
• Release to small users first
• Monitor success
• Roll out fully
✅ 51. What is CI/CD?
CI → Developers push code → build → test → quality checks
CD → Automated deployment to QA/Prod
Tools:
• Jenkins
• GitHub Actions
• GitLab CI
• Azure DevOps
✅ 52. What is Reverse Proxy & Load Balancer
Reverse Proxy:
• Accepts request → routes internally
• Adds caching, logging, security Example: NGINX
Load Balancer:
• Distributes requests to multiple servers Example: AWS ELB
Often same product acts as both.
✅ 53. What is JWT Token Structure?
JWT has 3 parts:
• Header → algorithm
• Payload → user data
• Signature → verify authenticity
Format:
xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz 
Server validates signature → stateless authentication.
✅ 54. What is OAuth2?
Authorization protocol (not authentication).
Flows: ✅ Authorization Code (most secure)
✅ Client Credentials (service-to-service)
✅ Password (legacy)
Used by:
• Google Login
• GitHub Login
• Facebook Login
✅ 55. Preventing SQL Injection
• Use PreparedStatement
• Never concatenate SQL strings
• Validate user input
• ORM frameworks (Hibernate/JPA)
Vulnerable:
"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='" + input + "'" 
Safe:
PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=?"); 
✅ 56. Preventing XSS
XSS happens when malicious script runs in browser.
Fix:
• Escape HTML output
• Sanitize user inputs
• Use Content-Security-Policy headers
• Never trust user input in UI
✅ 57. CSRF & How to prevent it
CSRF = user’s browser sends valid session cookies without permission.
Fix:
• CSRF tokens
• SameSite cookies
• Validate origin
Spring:
http.csrf().enable(); 
✅ 58. Design a URL Shortener
System design concepts:
• Base-62 encoding from ID → short URL
• Redis cache for fast lookup
• DB for persistence
• NGINX reverse proxy
• Write-heavy → async queue
Flow:
• User sends long URL
• Service generates short code
• GET /abc123 → 302 Redirect
✅ 59. Load Balancing Strategies
• Round Robin
• Least Connections
• IP Hash
• Weight-based
Used in:
• NGINX
• AWS ELB
• Kubernetes Services
✅ 60. Difference between Unit Test & Integration Test
FeatureUnit TestIntegration TestScopeOne class/methodEnd-to-end flowSpeedVery fastSlowUsesMockito, JUnitTestContainers, real DB 
Example Unit Test:
when(repo.findById(1)).thenReturn(user); 
Integration Test:
• Runs with DB
• Full API testing

Perfect ✅
Here is the final batch — Questions 61 to 80, completing the full 80-question interview set.
✅ FULL STACK JAVA INTERVIEW Q&A
✅ (Batch 4: Questions 61–80)
✅ 61. Mockito Annotations — @Mock, @Spy, @InjectMocks
• @Mock → creates dummy object, behavior defined with when(...)
• @Spy → real object but you can stub specific methods
• @InjectMocks → Injects mocks into target class
Example:
@Mock UserRepository repo; @InjectMocks UserService service; 
✅ 62. What is Testcontainers?
Library to spin up real DBs / Kafka / Redis inside Docker during integration tests.
Benefits: ✅ No in-memory fake DBs
✅ Same environment as production
✅ Consistent results
✅ 63. Synchronous vs Asynchronous communication
TypeExampleProsConsSyncREST call Order → PaymentSimpleCaller waitsAsyncKafka event “PaymentCompleted”Fast, decoupledDebugging harder 
✅ 64. What is Kafka used for?
Distributed message broker:
• High throughput
• Horizontal scaling
• Stores messages (durable)
• Used for event-driven systems
Use cases:
• Order events
• Transaction logs
• Analytics pipelines
✅ 65. Producer vs Consumer vs Topic vs Partition
• Producer → sends messages
• Consumer → reads messages
• Topic → message category
• Partition → splits load horizontally
More partitions ⇒ more consumers ⇒ high performance.
✅ 66. What is Idempotency Key?
Client sends unique key per request.
If same request repeats → server detects duplicate and ignores.
Used for:
• Payment APIs
• Wallet recharge
• Order creation
✅ 67. Difference between Monolith, Microservices, and Serverless
• Monolith → one big deployable unit
• Microservices → many small services with APIs
• Serverless (AWS Lambda) → code runs without servers; pay-per-execution
✅ 68. What is Distributed Tracing?
Tracking request across multiple services.
Tools:
• Zipkin
• Jaeger
• ELK
• AWS X-Ray
Helps debug latency and failures.
✅ 69. Caching Types
• In-memory (ConcurrentHashMap)
• Local cache → Caffeine, EhCache
• Distributed → Redis, Hazelcast
Cache annotations:
@Cacheable("users") @CacheEvict("users") 
✅ 70. Horizontal vs Vertical scaling
HorizontalVerticalAdd more machinesAdd more CPU/RAM to same machineCloud-friendlyHardware limitMore resilientSingle point failure 
✅ 71. Difference between PUT, PATCH, POST
• POST → create
• PUT → replace full object
• PATCH → partially update
Example:
PATCH /users/10 { "email": "a@b.com" } 
✅ 72. What happens in a 3-tier architecture?
• UI layer → React, Angular
• Backend API → Spring Boot, Node
• Database → MySQL, Mongo, Postgres
✅ 73. CQRS
• Command Query Responsibility Segregation
• Write model separated from read model
• Improves performance and scalability
• Useful in event sourcing systems
✅ 74. Event Sourcing
Instead of saving current state, store events that lead to current state:
• order_created
• order_confirmed
• order_cancelled
System rebuilds state from events.
Used in banking, payments, trading systems.
✅ 75. Producer–Consumer Problem
Multi-thread problem:
• Producer adds item
• Consumer removes item
• Must synchronize
Solution:
• BlockingQueue
• wait/notify
• Semaphores
BlockingQueue<Integer> q = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10); 
✅ 76. LRU Cache Implementation
• Doubly Linked List + HashMap
• O(1) add, remove, get
Used in:
• Caching
• Web browsers
• Memory management
✅ 77. Detect cycle in LinkedList
Use Floyd's algorithm:
• Slow pointer moves 1 step
• Fast pointer moves 2 steps
• If they meet → cycle exists
✅ 78. When to use Redis?
• Caching
• Session storage
• Leaderboards
• Rate limiting
• Pub/Sub messaging
Very fast — stores data in memory.
✅ 79. When to use NoSQL over SQL?
Pick NoSQL when: ✅ Millions of records
✅ Flexible schema
✅ Horizontal scaling
✅ JSON data
✅ Real-time analytics
Examples:
• MongoDB — documents
• Cassandra — wide-column
• Elasticsearch — full-text search
✅ 80. HR Question — Biggest challenge you solved?
✅ Situation
✅ Task
✅ Action
✅ Result (STAR format)
Example Answer:
"In our microservices system, peak traffic caused DB slowdown. I added Redis caching, asynchronous processing with Kafka, and a rate limiter at gateway. Response time improved from 2.3s to 200ms and DB load dropped by 70%."
