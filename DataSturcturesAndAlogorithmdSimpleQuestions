Here are quick DSA questions that can be solved in under 5 minutes, and are very common in interviews:


---

✅ Easy–Medium DSA Questions (5-minute solvable)

✅ 1. Reverse a String

Input: "hello"
Output: "olleh"

✅ One-liner in many languages


---

✅ 2. Check if a String is Palindrome

Input: "madam"
Output: true

Just compare characters from left & right.


---

✅ 3. Find Missing Number in 1..N

Input: [1, 2, 4, 5]
Output: 3

Formula:

missing = n*(n+1)/2 - sum(arr)


---

✅ 4. Find First Non-Repeating Character

Input: "aabbcddee"
Output: 'c'

Use frequency map.


---

✅ 5. Remove Duplicate Characters from String

Input: "banana"
Output: "ban"

Use Set to track seen chars.


---

✅ 6. Check if Two Strings Are Anagrams

Input: "listen", "silent"
Sort both → compare OR use frequency map.


---

✅ 7. Find Second Largest Element

Input: [5,1,9,2,7]
Output: 7

Track max & secondMax.


---

✅ 8. Merge Two Sorted Arrays

Example:

[1,3,5] + [2,4,6] → [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Two-pointer technique.


---

✅ 9. Count Frequency of Each Character

Input: "apple"
Output: {a=1, p=2, l=1, e=1}

Use HashMap.


---

✅ 10. Check Balanced Parentheses

Input: "{[()]}"
Output: true

Use stack.


---

✅ 11. Find Middle Element of Linked List

Use fast and slow pointers.


---

✅ 12. Detect Loop in LinkedList

Fast and slow pointers:

If they meet → loop exists



---

✅ 13. Find Intersection of Two Arrays

Use HashSet.


---

✅ 14. Move Zeros to End

Input: [1,0,6,0,3] → [1,6,3,0,0]

Two-pointer solution.


---

✅ 15. Fibonacci using DP

Avoid recursion stack overflow.


---

✅ 16. Check if Array Sorted

Traverse once.


---

✅ 17. Count Vowels in String

Check each character aeiou.


---

✅ 18. Sum of Digits

Example: 123 → 6


---

✅ 19. Print Prime Numbers Up To N

Simple sieve or loop.


---

✅ 20. Two Sum Problem

Given array and target, check if 2 numbers sum to target.
Use HashMap → O(n)
