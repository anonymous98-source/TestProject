For a developer with four years of experience, interview questions will focus on core concepts, practical application, best practices, performance optimization, and system design in both Spring Boot and React. 
Spring Boot Interview Questions
Core Concepts and Annotations:
Explain the internal workings of @SpringBootApplication, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.
What is "convention over configuration," and how does Spring Boot implement it?
Differentiate between @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller.
Explain Dependency Injection (DI) and compare constructor injection vs. setter/field injection, including which is preferred and why.
Data and Persistence:
What is Spring Data JPA, and how does it simplify database operations compared to traditional JDBC or Hibernate?
Explain the use of @Transactional and its attributes like propagation and isolation levels.
How do you handle database migrations (schema updates) in a Spring Boot application using tools like Flyway or Liquibase?
REST APIs and Exception Handling:
Describe how to build robust RESTful web services, including handling different HTTP methods and status codes.
How would you implement global exception handling in a REST API using @ControllerAdvice or @RestControllerAdvice?
Explain how to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for a React frontend to consume your API.
Security and Operations:
How do you secure a Spring Boot application using Spring Security? Mention concepts like CSRF protection, stateless authentication (JWT), and OAuth2.
What are Spring Boot Actuator endpoints, and how are they used for monitoring application health and metrics?
Explain the use of profiles (@Profile) for managing different configurations (e.g., development, testing, production) and the precedence of properties.
Advanced Topics/Scenario-Based:
How would you optimize the performance of a Spring Boot application under high load?
Describe a scenario where you would use Spring WebFlux (reactive programming) instead of traditional Spring MVC.
How do you handle circular dependencies between beans? 
React Interview Questions
Core Concepts:
Explain the Virtual DOM and the reconciliation process, and why React is faster than direct DOM manipulation.
Differentiate between functional and class components, especially in the context of Hooks.
What are props and state? Explain their differences and immutability.
Hooks:
Explain useState and useEffect in detail, including the purpose of the dependency array and how to handle side effects with and without cleanup.
When would you use useReducer instead of useState for state management?
Explain the difference between useMemo and useCallback and how they help in performance optimization.
How do you create and use custom Hooks to share stateful logic between components?
Advanced Patterns and Architecture:
What is prop drilling, and what techniques (Context API, Redux) can be used to avoid it?
Explain Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and Render Props as patterns for code reuse.
Discuss popular state management solutions (Redux, Zustand, Context API) and when you would choose one over the other.
Performance and Testing:
What are some techniques you use to optimize a slow React application (e.g., lazy loading, code splitting, memoization, virtualization)?
Explain error boundaries and how to implement them to catch errors in the render phase.
How do you test React components effectively using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library?
Integration (Spring Boot & React):
How do you handle user authentication and authorization between the React frontend and Spring Boot backend (e.g., JWT-based authentication flow)?
Describe how you structure your project to facilitate seamless API calls from the React app to the Spring Boot API, perhaps using Axios.
How do you deploy a full-stack application with a Spring Boot backend and a React frontend?
