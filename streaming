Nice touch 👍 — this is exactly the kind of professional finishing detail that makes the app feel complete.

Below is a clean, Swing-correct way to add a copyright footer with version v1.0, and exactly where to put it.


---

🎯 What we’ll add

At the bottom of the MainFrame, centered:

© 2026 Funds Manager • Version v1.0

✔ Always visible
✔ Does not interfere with main layout
✔ Looks professional (subtle, not loud)
✔ Easy to update version later

1️⃣ Code to ADD (Footer Panel)

Add this method to MainFrame.java

private JPanel createFooter() {
    JPanel footer = new JPanel(new BorderLayout());
    footer.setBorder(
            BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(6, 10, 6, 10)
    );

    JLabel copyright =
            new JLabel("© 2026 Funds Manager • Version v1.0",
                    SwingConstants.CENTER);

    copyright.setFont(
            new Font("Segoe UI", Font.PLAIN, 12)
    );
    copyright.setForeground(Color.GRAY);

    footer.add(copyright, BorderLayout.CENTER);
    return footer;
}

2️⃣ Where to PUT it (IMPORTANT)

In your MainFrame constructor, you currently have:

add(createHeader(), BorderLayout.NORTH);
add(createMainContent(), BorderLayout.CENTER);

🔁 Change it to:

add(createHeader(), BorderLayout.NORTH);
add(createMainContent(), BorderLayout.CENTER);
add(createFooter(), BorderLayout.SOUTH);

That’s it.
No other changes required.

3️⃣ Result in UI

At the bottom of your app window you’ll see:

> © 2026 Funds Manager • Version v1.0



Subtle gray text, centered, always visible.


---

🧠 Why this is the right approach

✔ Uses BorderLayout.SOUTH (correct Swing pattern)
✔ Footer stays fixed even when content scrolls
✔ No hard-coding inside UI logic
✔ Easy to update version number
✔ Works with Dark Mode (FlatLaf handles colors well)


---

4️⃣ Optional (if you want later)

You can improve it further by:

Making version dynamic (BuildInfo.VERSION)

Adding clickable “About” dialog

Adding company name

Showing build date


If you want that next, just say 👍
