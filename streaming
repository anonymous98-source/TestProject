3.1 User Roles & Rights  
BC & OR is a workflow-based system where users are pre-assigned a task based on their roles and rights in BC & OR. 
No role creation is required for branches, CPCs and Learning Centres. However, for LHOs, AOs and RBOs Checker 
and Controller roles have to be assigned by the Circle Admin as and when required as the heads will be having
