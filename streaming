Excellent 👌 Let’s make this presentation-ready, professional, and visually structured — not basic.

Below you’ll get:

1. 🎯 Enhanced Sequence Diagram (with autonumber + clear approval stages)


2. 🏊 Swimlane Activity Diagram (role-based lanes)


3. 🧩 Improved Class Diagram (with relationships, enums, composition)


4. 📊 Ready-to-use Presentation Slide Structure


5. 🎨 Styling improvements for Mermaid

1️⃣ Professional Sequence Diagram (Plan Approval Flow)

sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Maker
    actor Checker
    actor Controller
    participant System as BC & OR Workflow Engine
    participant DB as Database

    Maker->>System: Create Plan (Draft)
    System->>DB: Save Plan
    DB-->>System: Plan Stored
    System-->>Maker: Draft Saved

    Maker->>System: Submit Plan
    System->>DB: Update Status = SUBMITTED
    System->>Checker: Notification Triggered

    Checker->>System: Review Plan

    alt Rejected by Checker
        System->>DB: Update Status = REJECTED
        System-->>Maker: Return with Remarks
    else Approved by Checker
        System->>DB: Update Status = CHECKER_APPROVED
        System->>Controller: Forward for Final Approval
    end

    Controller->>System: Final Review

    alt Rejected by Controller
        System->>DB: Update Status = REJECTED
        System-->>Maker: Return with Remarks
    else Approved by Controller
        System->>DB: Update Status = APPROVED
        System-->>Maker: Plan Fully Approved
    end

✅ Improvements:

Autonumbered steps

Database interaction shown

Clear status transitions

Enterprise-level clarity

2️⃣ Swimlane Activity Diagram (End-to-End Workflow)

This version separates responsibilities by role.

flowchart LR

subgraph Maker
    M1[Create Plan]
    M2[Submit Plan]
    M3[Modify Plan]
end

subgraph Checker
    C1[Review Plan]
    C2{Approve?}
end

subgraph Controller
    CT1[Final Review]
    CT2{Approve?}
end

subgraph System
    S1[Update Status]
    S2[Send Notification]
end

Start((Start)) --> M1
M1 --> M2
M2 --> S1
S1 --> S2
S2 --> C1

C1 --> C2
C2 -- Reject --> S1
S1 --> M3
M3 --> M2

C2 -- Approve --> S1
S1 --> CT1
CT1 --> CT2

CT2 -- Reject --> S1
CT2 -- Approve --> End((Plan Approved))

✅ Why this is better:

Clear role segregation

Workflow engine shown

Loop handling included

Presentation-friendly

3️⃣ Enhanced Class Diagram (Enterprise Structured)

classDiagram

class User {
    +Long userId
    +String name
    +Role role
    +login()
    +logout()
}

class Plan {
    +Long planId
    +String title
    +PlanStatus status
    +Date createdDate
    +submit()
    +update()
}

class TestingReport {
    +Long reportId
    +ReportStatus status
}

class InvocationReport {
    +Long reportId
    +ReportStatus status
}

class WorkflowEngine {
    +submitPlan()
    +approvePlan()
    +rejectPlan()
    +notifyUser()
}

class Role {
    <<enumeration>>
    MAKER
    CHECKER
    CONTROLLER
    ADMIN
    SUPER_ADMIN
}

class PlanStatus {
    <<enumeration>>
    DRAFT
    SUBMITTED
    CHECKER_APPROVED
    APPROVED
    REJECTED
}

User --> Role
User "1" --> "*" Plan : creates
Plan --> WorkflowEngine
Plan --> TestingReport
Plan --> InvocationReport

✅ Improvements:

Enum types

Cardinality

Workflow engine separation

Clean OOP structure
