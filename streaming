Excellent 👍
Now this is a role-based approval governance workflow — so the correct UML approach is:

We will create:

1️⃣ UML Activity Diagram (Role-based Swimlane)
2️⃣ UML Sequence Diagram (Approval Routing)
3️⃣ Clean, enterprise horizontal layout
4️⃣ Maker ↔ Checker ↔ Alternate Checker ↔ Controller transitions
5️⃣ Proper rejection loops & tray behavior

This will represent Sections 3.6 to 3.10 professionally.

✅ 1️⃣ UML ACTIVITY DIAGRAM (Role-Based Swimlane Model)

This shows user separation clearly.

%%{init: {
  "theme": "base",
  "flowchart": {
    "curve": "basis",
    "nodeSpacing": 70,
    "rankSpacing": 120
  }
}}%%

%% ===== MAKER LANE =====
subgraph Maker
    M1[Plan Submitted]
    M2[Testing Submitted]
    M3[Invocation Submitted]
    M4[Receives Rejected Item as Draft]
end

%% ===== CHECKER LANE =====
subgraph Checker
    C1[Review Plan (All 7 Parts)]
    C2{Approve Plan?}
    
    C3[Review Testing Report]
    C4{Approve Testing?}
    
    C5[Review Invocation Report]
    C6{Approve Invocation?}
end

%% ===== ALT CHECKER =====
subgraph Alternate_Checker
    AC1[Review Plan (All 7 Parts)]
    AC2{Approve Plan?}
end

%% ===== CONTROLLER =====
subgraph Controller
    CT1[Review Plan]
    CT2{Approve Plan?}

    CT3[Review Testing Report]
    CT4{Approve Testing?}

    CT5[Review Invocation Report]
    CT6{Approve Invocation?}
end

%% ===== FLOW =====

%% PLAN FLOW
M1 --> C1 --> C2
C2 -- No --> M4
C2 -- Yes --> AC1
AC1 --> AC2
AC2 -- No --> M4
AC2 -- Yes --> CT1
CT1 --> CT2
CT2 -- No --> M4
CT2 -- Yes --> ApprovedPlan((Plan Approved))

%% TESTING FLOW
M2 --> C3 --> C4
C4 -- No --> M4
C4 -- Yes --> CT3
CT3 --> CT4
CT4 -- No --> M4
CT4 -- Yes --> ApprovedTesting((Testing Approved))

%% INVOCATION FLOW
M3 --> C5 --> C6
C6 -- No --> M4
C6 -- Yes --> CT5
CT5 --> CT6
CT6 -- No --> M4
CT6 -- Yes --> ApprovedInvocation((Invocation Approved))

🎯 What This Clearly Shows

PLAN Approval Hierarchy

Maker → Checker → Alternate Checker → Controller

TESTING Approval Hierarchy

Maker → Checker → Controller

INVOCATION Approval Hierarchy

Maker → Checker → Controller

Rejection Behavior

Any rejection: → Returns to Maker
→ Appears as Draft
→ Comments recorded

✅ 2️⃣ UML SEQUENCE DIAGRAM – Approval Routing

This shows interaction flow clearly.

sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Maker
    actor Checker
    actor AltChecker
    actor Controller
    participant System

    Maker->>System: Submit Plan
    System->>Checker: Notify Plan Pending

    Checker->>System: Approve / Reject

    alt Rejected by Checker
        System->>Maker: Return as Draft with Comments
    else Approved by Checker
        System->>AltChecker: Forward Plan
    end

    AltChecker->>System: Approve / Reject

    alt Rejected by AltChecker
        System->>Maker: Return as Draft
    else Approved
        System->>Controller: Forward Plan
    end

    Controller->>System: Final Approval / Reject

    alt Rejected by Controller
        System->>Maker: Return as Draft
    else Approved
        System->>Maker: Plan Approved Successfully
    end

🏢 Governance Highlights You Can Explain

✔ Multi-level verification
✔ 7-part mandatory verification for plan
✔ Controlled routing logic
✔ Comment-based rejection
✔ Draft rollback mechanism
✔ Role-based access control

🔥 If You Want EVEN More Enterprise

I can now generate:

🔷 Unified Master Diagram (Plan + Testing + Invocation Combined)

🔷 BPMN 2.0 Version (Audit Standard)

🔷 Architecture Layer Diagram (UI → Service → Workflow Engine → DB)

🔷 Status Lifecycle Diagram (Draft → Pending → Approved → Rejected)

🔷 RBAC Security UML

🔷 Database ER Diagram

🎯 Important Question

Is this for:

• Internal technical documentation
• Audit compliance presentation
• Senior management review
• Client demo
• Architecture discussion

Tell me the audience and I will refine the final enterprise-grade version accordingly 🚀
