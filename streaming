a. Approve/Reject BC & OR plan  
Step 1: Click on “+Plan” and then “Pending as Branch Checker”. Checker can view all the details and provide approval if the Plan is in 
order. In case of any discrepancies the plan may be rejected by the Checker. All 7 parts need to be verified before approving or rejecting.   
23  
Step 2: After verifying, the checker needs to approve or reject the plan. Rejecting the plan by Checker will put the plan on the tray of 
Maker. The checker can put comments stating the reason for rejecting the proposal. Approving the plan leads to submission of the plan 
to Alternate Branch/Office Checker. Once rejected, it will be shown as draft in the Maker tab.

You're right 👍 — the BC&OR System → Checker linkage is missing after the Maker submits the plan.

Currently:

M2 --> S1

But there is no flow from System to Checker (C1).


---

✅ Corrected Flow (With System → Checker Link Added)

Add this line:

S1 --> C1


---

🔧 Updated Mermaid Code (Fixed Version)

    M1[Create Plan]

🎯 What This Fix Achieves

Now the logical flow becomes:

1. Maker submits plan


2. System updates status


3. System routes to Checker


4. Approval/Rejection cycle continues properly

🔁 Optimize it to avoid repeated S1 calls

🎨 Improve layout alignment

🧠 Convert this into a proper UML Activity Diagram format for documentation

📄 Prepare this for your BC&OR report documentation
